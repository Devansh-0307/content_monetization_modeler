📌 YouTube Ad Revenue Prediction System

A complete end-to-end ML project with preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a Streamlit dashboard.

⭐ Project Overview

This project predicts YouTube ad revenue based on multiple video and channel-level features such as views, watch time, engagement, device type, country, and more.
It includes a complete machine-learning pipeline along with a Streamlit web app for real-time revenue prediction.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw YouTube analytics data

Engineer meaningful features

Train and compare multiple regression models

Select and save the best model

Deploy an interactive Streamlit UI to predict revenue in USD and INR

Provide insights into data distribution and model performance
